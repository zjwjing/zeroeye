## Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints

Each service exposes a health check endpoint:

| Service | Endpoint | Port |
|---------|----------|------|
| Backend API | `/health` | 8080 |
| Market Engine | `/health` | 8081 |
| Frailbox Runtime | `/health` | 8082 |
| Frontend | `/` | 3000 |

The health check returns a 200 OK response with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "3.2.0",
  "uptime_seconds": 86400,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Prometheus Metrics

Each service exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` on the same port as the
health check endpoint. The metrics are scraped by the Prometheus server every
15 seconds.

Key metrics to monitor:

| Metric | Type | Description | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `http_requests_total` | Counter | Total HTTP requests | - | - |
| `http_request_duration_ms` | Histogram | Request latency | p99 > 500ms | p99 > 2000ms |
| `http_errors_total` | Counter | HTTP error responses | > 1% of requests | > 5% of requests |
| `active_connections` | Gauge | Active connections | > 80% of max | > 95% of max |
| `memory_usage_bytes` | Gauge | Process memory | > 80% of limit | > 90% of limit |
| `cpu_usage_percent` | Gauge | CPU usage | > 70% | > 90% |
| `db_connection_pool_size` | Gauge | Database connections | > 80% of pool | > 95% of pool |
| `queue_depth` | Gauge | Message queue depth | > 1000 | > 10000 |
| `goroutine_count` | Gauge | Go routine count | > 5000 | > 10000 |
| `gc_pause_time_ms` | Histogram | GC pause time | > 100ms | > 500ms |

### Grafana Dashboards

Pre-built Grafana dashboards are available:

| Dashboard | Description | UID |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| System Overview | CPU, memory, disk, network | `tot-system-overview` |
| API Performance | Request latency, throughput, errors | `tot-api-performance` |
| Market Data | Order book, trade volume, spread | `tot-market-data` |
| Business Metrics | Active users, trades, volume | `tot-business-metrics` |
| Service Health | Per-service health and dependencies | `tot-service-health` |

### Alerting Rules

Alerts are sent to PagerDuty and Slack (#ops-alerts channel).

| Alert | Condition | Severity | Response Time |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| ServiceDown | Health check fails for 1 minute | Critical | 5 minutes |
| HighLatency | p99 latency > 2s for 5 minutes | Warning | 15 minutes |
| HighErrorRate | Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes | Critical | 10 minutes |
| LowDiskSpace | Disk usage > 90% | Warning | 1 hour |
| HighMemory | Memory > 90% for 10 minutes | Warning | 15 minutes |
| CertificateExpiry | TLS cert expires in < 7 days | Warning | 24 hours |
| DBConnectionPool | Pool exhaustion risk | Critical | 10 minutes |
| QueueBacklog | Queue depth > 10000 for 5 minutes | Warning | 15 minutes |

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Examples | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| SEV1 | Complete service outage | All users affected, data loss | Immediate |
| SEV2 | Major feature degradation | Core trading affected | 15 minutes |
| SEV3 | Minor feature degradation | Non-critical feature broken | 1 hour |
| SEV4 | Cosmetic issue | UI bug, typo | Next business day |

### Runbooks

Runbooks are maintained in the internal wiki under "Operations Runbooks."

Key runbooks:

- **Service Recovery**: Steps to restart and verify a failed service
- **Database Failover**: Steps to promote a replica to primary
- **Data Recovery**: Steps to restore from backup
- **Certificate Rotation**: Steps to update TLS certificates
- **Capacity Scaling**: Steps to scale services horizontally
- **Incident Post-Mortem**: Template for post-incident analysis

### Communication

During an incident, use the following channels:

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `#ops-alerts` | Automated alerts from monitoring |
| `#ops-incident` | Real-time incident coordination |
| `#ops-postmortem` | Post-incident discussion |
| PagerDuty | On-call engineer notification |
| Email | Stakeholder updates (SEV1 only) |

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Schedule

| Data | Frequency | Retention | Type |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| PostgreSQL | Daily | 30 days | Full dump |
| PostgreSQL WAL | Continuous | 7 days | WAL archive |
| Redis snapshot | Every 6 hours | 7 days | RDB file |
| Application logs | Daily | 90 days | Compressed archive |
| Configuration | Per change | 90 days | Git history |
| TLS certificates | Per change | 3 years | Encrypted backup |

### Backup Verification

Backups are verified weekly by restoring to a staging environment and running
integrity checks. The verification process takes approximately 4 hours for a
full database restore. The verification results are posted to `#ops-backups`.

TODO: The backup verification process is partially automated. The restore is
automated but the integrity checks require manual review. The manual review
involves checking that the restored database has the expected row counts and
that no tables are missing. The row count check was added after an incident
where a backup was taken while a migration was running, resulting in an
incomplete backup that restored without error but was missing 3 tables.

### Recovery Procedure

1. Identify the recovery point (time or transaction ID)
2. Stop all services that write to the database
3. Restore the database from the backup
4. Verify data integrity
5. Resume services
6. Verify application functionality

Estimated recovery time:
- Point-in-time recovery: 30-60 minutes
- Full restore from daily backup: 2-4 hours
- Full restore from weekly backup: 4-8 hours

## Database Administration

### Connection Pool Configuration

| Service | Min Connections | Max Connections | Timeout |
|---------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Backend API | 10 | 50 | 30s |
| Market Engine | 5 | 20 | 10s |
| Frailbox | 2 | 10 | 30s |
| Admin tools | 1 | 5 | 60s |

### Maintenance Windows

Scheduled maintenance windows:

| Environment | Day | Time (UTC) | Max Duration |
|-------------|-----|------------|--------------|
| Development | Any | Any | No limit |
| Staging | Wednesday | 14:00-16:00 | 2 hours |
| Production | Sunday | 06:00-08:00 | 2 hours |

Unscheduled maintenance requires:
1. CAB approval (change advisory board)
2. 48-hour notice to stakeholders
3. Documented rollback plan

### Common Database Tasks

Vacuum analyze:
```sql
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```

Reindex:
```sql
REINDEX DATABASE tent_production;
```

Kill idle transactions:
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'idle' AND age > interval '1 hour';
```

## Capacity Planning

### Resource Utilization

Current resource utilization (as of last review):

| Resource | Total | Used | Available | Trend |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| CPU (cores) | 64 | 32 | 32 | Stable |
| Memory (GB) | 256 | 144 | 112 | Growing +5%/month |
| Disk (TB) | 5 | 2.4 | 2.6 | Growing +3%/month |
| Network (Gbps) | 10 | 3.2 | 6.8 | Stable |
| DB Storage (TB) | 1.5 | 0.8 | 0.7 | Growing +8%/month |

### Scaling Triggers

| Resource | Scale Up | Scale Down |
|----------|----------|------------|
| CPU | > 70% for 10 minutes | < 30% for 30 minutes |
| Memory | > 80% for 10 minutes | < 50% for 30 minutes |
| Requests/sec | > 80% of capacity | < 30% of capacity |
| Queue depth | > 1000 for 5 minutes | < 100 for 15 minutes |

### Projected Growth

Based on current trends:
- Q2 2024: Need 20% more capacity
- Q3 2024: Need 35% more capacity
- Q4 2024: Need 50% more capacity

TODO: The growth projections have been consistently overestimated by
~40%. The overestimation was noticed in 2023 but the projection model
was never updated because the data science team that built the model
was dissolved in the 2023 reorg. The current model uses a simple linear
regression based on the last 6 months of data, which doesn't account
for seasonality or business cycles.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service won't start**
1. Check logs: `kubectl logs -n tent-production deployment/backend-api`
2. Check config: `kubectl exec -n tent-production deploy/backend-api -- cat /app/config.yaml`
3. Check database connectivity: `kubectl exec -n tent-production deploy/backend-api -- nc -zv postgresql 5432`
4. Check resource limits: `kubectl describe pod -n tent-production -l app=backend-api`

**High latency**
1. Check database query performance: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active'`
2. Check connection pool utilization
3. Check for slow external API calls
4. Check garbage collection metrics
5. Check for network congestion

**Memory leak**
1. Capture heap dump: `kubectl exec -n tent-production deploy/backend-api -- kill -3 1`
2. Analyze heap dump with your preferred tool
3. Check for unclosed connections or goroutine leaks
4. Review recent code changes

**Database connection exhaustion**
1. Find idle connections: `SELECT pid, state, query_start FROM pg_stat_activity ORDER BY query_start`
2. Kill long-running queries: `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' AND query_start < now() - interval '30 minutes'`
3. Check application connection pool settings
4. Consider increasing max_connections temporarily

**Certificate about to expire**
1. Generate new certificate
2. Update Kubernetes secret: `kubectl create secret tls tot-tls --cert=new.crt --key=new.key -n tent-production --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -`
3. Restart services: `kubectl rollout restart deployment -n tent-production`
4. Verify new certificate: `openssl s_client -connect api.example.com:443 -servername api.example.com`
## Dry-Run Rollback Summary

> **New in Issue #1**: Structured dry-run rollback summary export for deploy.py.

### Overview

The `--export-summary` flag on `deploy.py` generates structured text and JSON summary files
for rollback dry-runs, including detailed step breakdowns, risk assessments, and
auto-approve detection. No service state is modified.

### Usage

Basic dry-run with summary export (exports to current directory):
```
python3 deploy.py --env staging --service backend --rollback --version v3.1.0 --dry-run --export-summary
```

Export to a specific directory:
```
python3 deploy.py --env production --service frontend --rollback --version v3.2.0 --dry-run --export-summary /tmp/rollback-plans
```

### Output Files

| File | Format | Content |
|------|--------|---------|
| rollback_dry_run.txt | Text | Human-readable summary with service info, plans, warnings |
| rollback_dry_run.json | JSON | Machine-parseable structured data |

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "summary_type": "dry_run_rollback",
  "generated_at": "2026-06-21T12:00:00Z",
  "filter": {
    "service": "backend",
    "environment": "staging"
  },
  "totals": {
    "services_included": 1,
    "total_rollback_steps": 7
  },
  "warnings": ["Manual approval required"],
  "plans": [
    {
      "service": "backend",
      "deployment": "backend-api",
      "language": "rust",
      "namespace": "tent-staging",
      "kube_context": "staging-cluster",
      "target_version": "v3.1.0",
      "risk_note": "Standard risk: staging validation environment",
      "planned_actions": ["...7 actions..."],
      "rollback_steps": ["...7 steps..."],
      "generated_at": "2026-06-21T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Secret Redaction

The summary automatically redacts secret-like values (API keys, passwords, tokens, bearer
authorizations) from all summary output fields to prevent accidental credential exposure.
This applies to both text and JSON exports.

### Module Integration

The dry-run summary logic lives in `tools/deploy_dry_run_summary.py` and exposes:

| Function | Purpose | Returns |
|----------|---------|---------|
| build_rollback_plan(service, env, version, services, envs) | Build a single service rollback plan | dict or empty dict for unknown |
| build_summary(plans, env, service_opt, filter_secrets) | Aggregate plans into a summary | dict |
| export_summary(summary, output_dir, base_name) | Write text and JSON files | dict with json and text paths |
| format_text_summary(summary) | Render summary as formatted text | str |
| redact_summary(data) | Recursively redact secrets from a dict | dict |
