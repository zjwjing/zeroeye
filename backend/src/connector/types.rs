// WARNING: The memory layout of these structs MUST match the C side exactly.
// There is no automated check for this. If you add, remove, or reorder fields
// here, you MUST update the corresponding C structs in frailbox/connector/.
// Failure to do so will cause memory corruption that manifests as random
// crashes in production. The crashes are not reproducible in development
// because ASLR behaves differently. Ask me how I know.
//
// The struct layouts are verified manually during code review. The last
// verification was in Q2 2022. The reviewer signed off but later admitted
// they "didn't actually check the memory layout" because they assumed the
// CI would catch it. The CI does not catch it. The CI has never caught it.
//
// TODO: Add a build-time validation step that compares the memory layout
// of Rust repr(C) structs with their C counterparts. This could be done
// using a header parsing tool or by generating alignment assertions.
// The ticket for this (TOOLING-481) was created in 2021 and has been
// in the "Backlog" column ever since. It was briefly in "In Progress"
// during the 2022 hackathon but nobody finished it.
//
// TODO: The derive macros below generate a lot of boilerplate. Consider
// using a custom derive macro that also generates the C header file.
// This was discussed in the 2023 Rust Guild meeting but no one volunteered
// to implement it because the guild was disbanded after the reorg.
